A joke that I perhaps took too far: when your friends say they want an online, real-time, multiplayer version of [Ricochet Robots](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51/ricochet-robots) they _probably_ don't mean it literally. I'm not even very good at it.

Despite that though, Ricochet Robots provides a rich seam of interesting programming problems to solve: how to represent the board with obstacles, how to calculate and validate moves, win states, etc. Built with a Symfony backend and a React frontend, this is a mostly working multiplayer version of the board game that, despite me abandoning, has had a lot of uptake.

Orthogonal Automatons has a working solver (something I have tried and [spin out to its own project](https://github.com/johnnoel/ricochet-robots-solver)) which I had big plans to utilise to provide daily challenges of different difficulties. As is often the case with these peculiar project undertakings though, once I've mined what I see as the "interesting" problems my enthusiasm evaporates. The project needs a lot of work, not least of which is a UI refresh as well as some onboarding to go through all of the different game types. The [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/VDlbXu9G/ricochet-robots) is a good indicator of its current status.

The project doesn't solve the core issue of Ricochet Robots being a communal game though, so it still works best with a real-time side-channel (Discord, Zoom, Google Meet etc.). It also doesn't solve how to fit a usable 16x16 grid onto a mobile device.

Regardless, the project was fun and engaging for several months and I still have plans to release the source code (as some people have requested!) At Some Point Soon<sup>TM</sup>.
