My original domain registered in 2005 and from the heady days when coming up with an online handle was a case of jamming two words together and hoping it hadn't been taken by anyone else.

chaostangent.com was a Wordpress site and hosted a variety of different kinds of posts from [toy projects I was working on](https://chaostangent.com/2006/08/screenshotter/) to [travel writing from holidays](https://chaostangent.com/category/holidays/cuba-2007/) to [video game playthroughs](https://chaostangent.com/category/videogames/hitman-blood-money/) long before live-streaming had taken off. In 2007 though I settled into anime reviews and essays and enjoyed moderate success (for what was then still _very_ niche) for several years. I even had my own [hate mob](https://chaostangent.com/2010/07/3-episode-taste-test-amagami-ss-gentle-bite-ss/#responses) at one point!

I moved away from Wordpress in 2012 and switched to a custom build using the [Symfony 2 framework](https://symfony.com/). Since then chaostangent.com has been my testbed for different ideas and implementations (recently around static site generators) seeing as it has a large corpus of content - both text and media - and still gets a surprising amount of traffic so isn't entirely hidden.

My interest in anime has never waned entirely but my ability, and desire, to write engaging posts about it did; along with the general trend away from personal sites and blogs, I stopped writing in 2015 with a brief and unsuccessful attempt to rekindle that spark in 2017. So while not entirely archived, it is on hold for the forseeable future.
